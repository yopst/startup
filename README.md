# Stream of Consciousness

## Elevator Pitch

Have you ever been frustrated or in a state of awe, and you want to write down your ideas and thought, maybe share them with your friends, but don't have the energy or time to use formal grammar or even understand where to start? Stream of Consciousness is a social media website that allows you to just write or vent your thoughts as they come to you. You can invite your friends to join a "Dream" which you host and can set parameters called veils on what they can see. You can also just keep your thoughts to yourself to organize later in very own dream journal.
